    "\n",
    "3. **Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?**\n",
    "   - Yes, Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers. For example, `Variable` and `variable` would be considered two different identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is the correct extension of the Python file?**\n",
    "   - The correct extension of the Python file is `.py`.\n",

    "   - Python code is interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?**\n",
    "   - Some blocks of code used to define in Python are:\n",
    "     - Function: defined using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "     - Class: defined using the `class` keyword.\n",
    "     - Conditional statements: defined using `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords.\n",
    "     - Looping constructs: defined using `for` and `while` keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?**\n",
    "   - The `#` character is used to give single-line comments in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Mention functions which can help us to find the version of Python that we are currently working on?**\n",
    "   - The functions `sys.version` and `platform.python_version()` can be used to find the version of Python that is currently being used.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import sys\n",
    "     import platform\n",
    "\n",
    "     print(sys.version)\n",
    "     print(platform.python_version())\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called __________.**\n",
    "   - `lambda`\n",
    "\n",

    "    - `pip` stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\" or \"Pip Installs Python\".\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Mention a few built-in functions in Python?**\n",
    "    - Some built-in functions in Python include `print()`, `len()`, `type()`, `input()`, `sum()`, and `max()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?**\n",
    "    - An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What are the benefits of using Python?**\n",
    "    - Benefits of using Python include:\n",
    "      - Easy to read and write syntax.\n",
    "      - Extensive standard library and third-party modules.\n",
    "      - Cross-platform compatibility.\n",
    "      - Support for multiple programming paradigms.\n",
    "      - Strong community support.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **How is memory managed in Python?**\n",
    "    - Memory in Python is managed by the Python Memory Manager. It includes a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager. The `garbage collector` is used to release memory when objects are no longer in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?**\n",
    "    - Steps to install Python on Windows and set path variables:\n",
    "      1. Download the Python installer from the official Python website.\n",
    "      2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard. Ensure you check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH\".\n",
    "      3. Verify the installation by opening a command prompt and typing `python --version`.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Is indentation required in Python?**\n",
    "    - Yes, indentation is required in Python to define the level of nesting of code blocks. It is used to define the scope of loops, functions, classes, etc."
